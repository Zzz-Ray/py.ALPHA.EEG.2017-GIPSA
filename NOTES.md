- Does Greg have the single raw continuous recordings ? It would be better for creating the Raw file and also sliding-window for statistics evolution

- There's a problem with (at least) subject 3 : the closed state is actually open state ! Will have to check this with all other subjects

- Remember creating a requirements.txt file when finishing the release

- Create a documentation for the AlphaWaves dataset !
